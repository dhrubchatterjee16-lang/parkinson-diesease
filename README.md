# 🧠 NeuroDetect: Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

**NeuroDetect** is a machine learning project designed to aid in the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). By analyzing vocal acoustic measurements from patients, the model identifies patterns associated with the disease with high precision.



## 📌 Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Research shows that roughly 90% of people with Parkinson's exhibit vocal impairments. This project leverages the **UCI Machine Learning Repository Parkinson's Dataset** to build a classifier capable of distinguishing healthy individuals.
